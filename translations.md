Thanks to Ashraf Ali Khalaf for translating the book, you can read the whole book online at <http://www.khaledhosny.org/byte-of-python/index.html> or you can download it from [sourceforge.net](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/omlx/byteofpython_arabic.pdf?use_mirror=osdn) for more info see <http://itwadi.com/byteofpython_arabi>.

## Azerbaijani

Jahangir Shabiyev (c.shabiev@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Azerbaijani. The translation is in progress at https://www.gitbook.com/book/jahangir-sh/piton-sancmasi


## Brazilian Portuguese

There are two translations in various levels of completion and accessibility. The older translation is now missing/lost, and newer translation is incomplete.

Samuel Dias Neto (samuel.arataca@gmail.com) made the first Brazilian Portuguese translation (older translation) of this book when Python was in 2.3.5 version. This is no longer publicly accessible.

[Rodrigo Amaral](http://rodrigoamaral.net) (rodrigoamaral@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Brazilian Portuguese, (newer translation) which still remains to be completed.

## Catalan

Moises Gomez (moisesgomezgiron@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Catalan. The translation is in progress.

> Moisès Gómez - I am a developer and also a teacher of programming (normally for people without any previous experience).
>
> Some time ago I needed to learn how to program in Python, and Swaroop's work was really helpful. Clear, concise, and complete enough. Just what I needed.
>
> After this experience, I thought some other people in my country could take benefit from it too. But English language can be a barrier.
>
> So, why not try to translate it? And I did for a previous version of BoP.
>
> I my country there are two official languages. I selected the Catalan language assuming that others will translate it to the more widespread Spanish.

## Chinese

Translations are available at <http://woodpecker.org.cn/abyteofpython_cn/chinese/> and <http://zhgdg.gitcafe.com/static/doc/byte_of_python.html>.

Juan Shen (orion_val@163.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Chinese.

> I am a postgraduate at Wireless Telecommunication Graduate School, Beijing University of Technology, China PR. My current research interest is on the synchronization, channel estimation and multi-user detection of multicarrier CDMA system. Python is my major programming language for daily simulation and research job, with the help of Python Numeric, actually. I learned Python just half a year before, but as you can see, it's really easy-understanding, easy-to-use and productive. Just as what is ensured in Swaroop's book, 'It's my favorite programming language now'.
>
> 'A Byte of Python' is my tutorial to learn Python. It's clear and effective to lead you into a world of Python in the shortest time. It's not too long, but efficiently covers almost all important things in Python. I think 'A Byte of Python' should be strongly recommendable for newbies as their first Python tutorial. Just dedicate my translation to the potential millions of Python users in China.

## Chinese Traditional

Fred Lin (gasolin@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Chinese Traditional.

It is available at <http://code.google.com/p/zhpy/wiki/ByteOfZhpy>.

An exciting feature of this translation is that it also contains the _executable chinese python sources_ side by side with the original python sources.

> Fred Lin - I'm working as a network firmware engineer at Delta Network, and I'm also a contributor of TurboGears web framework.
>
> As a python evangelist (:-p), I need some material to promote python language. I found 'A Byte of Python' hit the sweet point for both newbies and experienced programmers. 'A Byte of Python' elaborates the python essentials with affordable size.
>
> The translation are originally based on simplified chinese version, and soon a lot of rewrite were made to fit the current wiki version and the quality of reading.
>
> The recent chinese traditional version also featured with executable chinese python sources, which are achieved by my new 'zhpy' (python in chinese) project (launch from Aug 07).
>
> zhpy(pronounce (Z.H.?, or zippy) build a layer upon python to translate or interact with python in chinese(Traditional or Simplified). This project is mainly aimed for education.

## French

Gregory (coulix@ozforces.com.au) has volunteered to translate the book to French.

Gérard Labadie (gerard.labadie@gmail.com) has completed to translate the book to French.

## German

Lutz Horn (lutz.horn@gmx.de), Bernd Hengelein (bernd.hengelein@gmail.com) and Christoph Zwerschke (cito@online.de) have volunteered to translate the book to German.

Their translation is located at <http://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub//sourceforge/a/ab/abop-german.berlios/>

Lutz Horn says:

> I'm 32 years old and have a degree of Mathematics from University of Heidelberg, Germany. Currently I'm working as a software engineer on a publicly funded project to build a web portal for all things related to computer science in Germany.The main language I use as a professional is Java, but I try to do as much as possible with Python behind the scenes. Especially text analysis and conversion is very easy with Python. I'm not very familiar with GUI toolkits, since most of my programming is about web applications, where the user interface is build using Java frameworks like Struts. Currently I try to make more use of the functional programming features of Python and of generators.  After taking a short look into Ruby, I was very impressed with the use of blocks in this language. Generally I like the dynamic nature of languages like Python and Ruby since it allows me to do things not possible in more static languages like Java.I've searched for some kind of introduction to programming, suitable to teach a complete non-programmer. I've found the book 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python', and 'Dive into Python'. The first is good for beginners but to long to translate. The second is not suitable for beginners. I think 'A Byte of Python' falls nicely between these, since it is not too long, written to the point, and at the same time verbose enough to teach a newbie. Besides this, I like the simple DocBook structure, which makes translating the text a generation the output in various formats a charm.

Bernd Hengelein says:

> Lutz and me are going to do the german translation together. We just started with the intro and preface but we will keep you informed about the progress we make. Ok, now some personal things about me. I am 34 years old and playing with computers since the 1980's, when the "Commodore C64" ruled the nurseries. After studying computer science I started working as a software engineer. Currently I am working in the field of medical imaging for a major german company. Although C++ is the main language I (have to) use for my daily work, I am constantly looking for new things to learn.Last year I fell in love with Python, which is a wonderful language, both for its possibilities and its beauty. I read somewhere in the net about a guy who said that he likes python, because the code looks so beautiful. In my opinion he's absolutly right. At the time I decided to learn python, I noticed that there is very little good documentation in german available. When I came across your book the spontaneous idea of a german translation crossed my mind. Luckily, Lutz had the same idea and we can now divide the work.I am looking forward to a good cooperation!

> _Massimo Lucci and Enrico Morelli_ - we are working at the University of Florence (Italy) - Chemistry Department. I (Massimo) as service engineer and system administrator for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometers; Enrico as service engineer and system administrator for our CED and parallel / clustered systems. We are programming on python since about seven years, we had experience working with Linux platforms since ten years. In Italy we are responsible and administrator for www.gentoo.it web site for Gentoo/Linux distrubution and www.nmr.it (now under construction) for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance applications and Congress Organization and Managements.That's all! We are impressed by the smart language used on your Book and we think this is essential for approaching the Python to new users (we are thinking about hundred of students and researcher working on our labs).

## Italian (second)

> I am Jeongbin Park, currently working as a Biophysics & Bioinformatics researcher in Korea.
>
> A year ago, I was looking for a good tutorial/guide for Python to introduce it to my colleagues, because using Python in such research fields is becoming inevitable due to the user base is growing more and more.
>
> But at that time only few Python books are available in Korean, so I decided to translate your ebook because it looks like one of the best guides that I have ever read!
>
> Currently, the book is almost completely translated in Korean, except some of the text in introduction chapter and the appendixes.
>
> Thank you again for writing such a good guide!

## Mongolian

Ariunsanaa Tunjin (luftballons2010@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Mongolian.

## Norwegian (bokmål)

Eirik Vågeskar is a high school student at [Sandvika videregående skole](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandvika_videreg%C3%A5ende_skole) in Norway, a [blogger](http://forbedre.blogspot.com/) and currently translating the book to Norwegian (bokmål).

> _Eirik Vågeskar_: I have always wanted to program, but because I speak a small language, the learning process was much harder. Most tutorials and books are written in very technical English, so most high school graduates will not even have the vocabulary to understand what the tutorial is about. When I discovered this book, all my problems were solved. "A Byte of Python" used simple non-technical language to explain a programming language that is just as simple, and these two things make learning Python fun. After reading half of the book, I decided that the book was worth translating. I hope the translation will help people who have found themself in the same situation as me (especially young people), and maybe help spread interest for the language among people with less technical knowledge.

## Polish

> _Paul-Sebastian Manole_ - I'm a second year Computer Science student at Spiru Haret University, here in Romania. I'm more of a self-taught programmer and decided to learn a new language, Python. The web told me there was no better way to do so but read ''A Byte of Python''. That's how popular this book is (congratulations to the author for writing such an easy to read book). I started liking Python so I decided to help translate the latest version of Swaroop's book in Romanian. Although I could be the one with the first initiative, I'm just one volunteer so if you can help, please join me.

> We are a non-profit organization called "Translation for education". We represent a group of people, mainly students and professors, of the Slavonic University. Here are students from different departments: linguistics, chemistry, biology, etc. We try to find interesting publications on the Internet that can be relevant for us and our university colleagues. Sometimes we find articles by ourselves; other times our professors help us choose the material for translation. After obtaining permission from authors we translate articles and post them in our blog which is available and accessible to our colleagues and friends. These translated publications often help students in their daily study routine.
